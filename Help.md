Story Title: SALT-XXXX: Implement Proxy/Credit Server Startup Logic

Description:

This story covers the implementation of the proxy/credit server startup logic.  The server needs to correctly identify and utilize license information (regular or credit) during startup, determining the appropriate operating mode. This implementation will handle the logic for parsing server ID features and initializing the server accordingly.

Acceptance Criteria:

 * Regular Mode Startup:

   * When configured with a regular license, the server starts in regular mode.

   * Communication with the CLS/Mock server and SAMAuth is disabled in regular mode.

   * The server startup process completes without errors or exceptions.

 * Credit Mode Startup:

   * When configured with a credit license, the server starts in credit mode.

   * The server correctly parses and utilizes the credit license information.

   * Regular license information is ignored during credit mode startup.

   * The server startup process completes without errors or exceptions.

Test Cases:

 * TC_Startup_RegularMode: Unit test verifying regular mode startup with a valid regular license.

 * TC_Startup_CreditMode: Unit test verifying credit mode startup with a valid credit license.

Story Points: (Estimate based on complexity - likely 3 or 5)

Notes:

 * This story focuses on the implementation of the startup logic itself.  Testing (beyond basic unit tests) will be handled in separate stories.

 * Error handling (e.g., invalid licenses) will be implemented and tested as part of this story, but specific error scenarios may be covered in separate test cases.
