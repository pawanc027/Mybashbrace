SALT-XXXX: Verify Proxy/Credit Server Startup Functionality

Description:

This story covers the testing of the proxy/credit server startup functionality.  The tests will verify the server's ability to correctly identify and utilize license information (regular or credit) during startup, ensuring it enters the appropriate operating mode. This includes validating the parsing of server ID features and the subsequent server initialization.

Acceptance Criteria:

 * Regular Mode Startup:

   * When configured with a regular license, the server starts in regular mode.

   * Communication with the CLS/Mock server and SAMAuth is disabled in regular mode.

   * The server startup process completes without errors or exceptions.

 * Credit Mode Startup:

   * When configured with a credit license, the server starts in credit mode.

   * The server correctly parses and utilizes the credit license information.

   * Regular license information is ignored during credit mode startup.

   * The server startup process completes without errors or exceptions.

Test Cases:

 * TC_Startup_RegularMode: Test server startup in regular mode with a valid regular license.

 * TC_Startup_CreditMode: Test server startup in credit mode with a valid credit license
